/**

 * 
 * "Spring Securityâ€™s built-in CSRF protection has kicked in to prevent us
 * from shooting ourselves in the foot. All it wants is a token sent to
 * it in a header called "X-CSRF". The value of the CSRF token was available
 * server side in the HttpRequest attributes from the initial request that
 * loaded the home page. To get it to the client we could render it using a
 * dynamic HTML page on the server, or expose it via a custom endpoint, or
 * else we could send it as a cookie. The last choice is the best because
 * Angular has built in support for CSRF (which it calls "XSRF") based on
 * cookies.
 *
 * So on the server we need a custom filter that will send the cookie. Angular
 * wants the cookie name to be "XSRF-TOKEN" and Spring Security provides it as
 * a request attribute, so we just need to transfer the value from a request
 * attribute to a cookie:
 * 
 * We need to install this filter in the application somewhere, and it needs
 * to go after the Spring Security CsrfFilter so that the request attribute
 * is available."
